# Analysis of the Stock Market utilizing Excel and VBA

##Overivew of Project
The purpose of this project is to use code to automate collecting and analyzing key information from stock data to help our friend, Steve. In this scenario, Excel interacted with Visual Basic (VBA), the programming language used to perform this analysis to automate finding trends in a particular stock, Daqo, green energy stocks, and the stock market in general. Utilizing code is an effective way to perform the monotonous calculations and complicated logic for this project’s as it saves time and reduces human error. Steve wants to help his clients (his parents) so that they can be even prouder of him.

##Results
The code’s and the refactored code’s (as “Year Value Analysis” worksheet in excel book) visualtions in different scenarios are shown below. Refactored Code is the only code shown.

###Refactored Code

##Summary
The screenshots above showcase an original code’s output versus a refactored code’s output for two different years, 2017 and 2018. The visualization output of the code above showcases the purpose of the codes’ – to output key information of a market analysis of multiple stocks. The original codes’ execution times were slower than refactored code’s execution time indicating that refactoring the code improves the time efficiency of the code.
AS such, one advantage of refactoring codes is its efficiency increase. Refactoring benefits include less memory space being used on the computer, a better flow of logic that increase clarity for  both its computer and human code interpreters. However, the refactoring costs include wasted time if there is no need to refactor since there is a working product – a chair is a chair from a practicality standpoint. It may be pointless act if time is a constraint. There is risk disorganization and creating problems future issues that can be difficult to rectify.
Refactoring improves the efficiency of the code which has many benefits including less computer memory utilization. Refactoring is probably better suited for longer code relative to this project’s task. It took around 0.7 seconds for the original un-refactored code to run for Steve’s project. It’s nice that the refactored code runs faster, but it probably isn’t too practical to apply for a task relatively simple. However, since Steve’s dataset isn’t too big, it probably isn’t worth refactoring. However, if the dataset was larger refactoring may be a good choice for those looking to save time.
